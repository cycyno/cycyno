<p align="center">ৎ 𓈒   always up to cuddles, i love them so dont be afraid to cuddle me!! it honestly does not matter if i know you or nah, just go ahead,, except if you'd like to be friends, that's a no, unless i know you from regiments. i just don't like being friends with strangers, but if they're from one of the regis i've joined then i dont mind, pls dont ask why and very sorry. although i would love cuddle buddies! but perhaps when we share the same interest, or we've cuddled a few times, i might want to be your friend ^_^. though i'm pretty shy so you'd have to approach me first.    𓂃
